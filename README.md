# CrashlyticsDelegateExample
I can't compile a project with the Crashlytics Delegate for an Objective C++ file so I asked [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52600419/cannot-find-protocol-declaration-for-crashlyticsdelegate-when-compiling-object) question on Stack Overflow. This project was created to make it easy for someone to help figure out how to make the project compile.
